# blox

A Clojure library designed to create 3d models. 

## Usage

The simplest way to try this out is to execute the example functions tx0 .. tx4 towards the end of the blox.scad namespace. These generate .scad files in the out directory which can be viewed with the Openscad software available from [OpenSCAD.org](http://www.openscad.org/index.html). Or you can just take a look at these pictures:
